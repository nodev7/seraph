# Winget Seraph  
**Automate Temporary Application Installations with Winget**  

Seraph is a lightweight PowerShell-based tool that installs applications using `winget` through the microsoft store and automatically removes them once they are closed. This allows for temporary installations without leaving unnecessary software behind.  

## How It Works  
1. Enter the application name.  
2. The tool confirms if it exists.  
3. The application is installed and monitored.  
4. Once closed, it is automatically removed.
